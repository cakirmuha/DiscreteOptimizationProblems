-A greedy solution is used to optimize Vehicle Routing Problem.
In this approach, customers except warehouse are marked after routed.
For current location of a vehicle, a customer having the minimum distance, and was not used before is selected
as candidate customer. These candidate customers are added to the route and marked.
If there is a violation of capacity, and algorithm does not select a customer, vehicle returns the warehouse(This especially causes uneffective results)
and a new vehicle begins to route. This approach is repeated until all customers are marked, and are used by a vehicle. However,
in a few of test cases, some customers may remain as unvisited since the number of vehicles may be insufficient. Therefore, this greedy approach
does not guarantee a feasible solution.


All relevant parameters and their settings:
This approach only takes a file name as parameters. This input file contains n+1 lines.
First line, 3 number (1 -> the number of customers, 2-> the number of vehicles, 3-> vehicle capacity)
Other n lines, demand and x-y coordinates of customers.
