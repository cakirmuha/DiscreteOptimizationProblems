-A heuristic sequential technique is used for graph coloring.
In this heuristic technique, after a node is colored, the color of this node does not change.
In order to provide better strategy, picking the next node to be colored is carefully done.
Degree based ordering technique is used to order nodes as selection criteria.
Specifically, Largest Degree Ordering(LDO) is applied to order nodes[1]. However, when there are two nodes having the same degree,
the node which has the higher number as the sum of the degrees of neighboring nodes than other same degreed node is selected.
After ordering was completed, all nodes are scanned, and sequentially colored.


All relevant parameters and their settings:
This approach only takes a file name as parameters. This input file contains e+1 lines.
First line, 2 number (1 -> the number of nodes, 2-> the number of edges)
Other e lines, edges between nodes.
